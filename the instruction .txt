we use in this project node mcu 8266 v3 


the project is control the servo motor using slidebar in html page 

by including html , css and javascribt and upload thim to esp

and connect the esp to wifi router and get the ip 

the ip of esp is static 

and you must include your static ip in the code
 
then connect your labtop of phone to the same router or access point
 
then you can write the ip of esp to your browser in the url bar 

and finally you can control you servo wiyh any angel using mouse or keyboard button up ,dwon, left and right
 
connect the servo red wire to 3.3v 

connect the servo black wire to GND IN ESP 

connect the servo orange or yellow wire to pin D7 

and the led to pin D6
 
and also this file is have and event hnadler of wifi 
first the esp was not connect to wifi the led will be on and off 
if it connect the led will off
if the connection interrupt the led will open 
and esp will retry to reconnect from itself 
and if it connect after the interrupt the led will be off from itself too

And I wish that anyone who benefited from this project would pray for me

thanks
